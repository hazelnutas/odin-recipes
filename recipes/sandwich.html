    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A sandwich is a great thing indeed. It is both simple and complex. Both adventurous and safe. A real feast and a real friend. Like any healthy thing, it connects any opposites and makes them whole.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>The shell</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread</li>
        <li>Maybe butter or a spread</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The insides</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Greens! Yum!</li>
        <li>A piece of tofu fried in soy sauce</li>
        <li>A strange sauce that a friend gave you last summer <em>(they made it themselves)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your shell by toasting the bread (or by taking it out of the bag) (or both).</li>
        <li>Do you want to spread something on the bread?</li>
        <li>Pile the ingredients:
            <ol type="i">
                <li>First the tofu.</li>
                <li>Or maybe the greens should go first? Are they supposed to be squished?</li>
                <li>Oh, you remembered you have a pickle in the fridge (or maybe your roomate does, but does it matter?). Let's add some.</li>
                <li>The mysterious sauce.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Add the upper part of the shell.</li>
        <li>Squish a little.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
